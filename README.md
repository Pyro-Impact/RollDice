# RollDice-RollDice.py is the main
Select any number of die to roll (int) and the system will randomly roll the die for you.

The Restart_Function.py is a custom module that can be implemented easily by either creating a package named "Shift15" or by renaming the package in the main file to use your own package.
Make sure to create an __init__.py file for the Restart_Function module.
